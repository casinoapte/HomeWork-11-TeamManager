## AIM:
The goal of this project was to create a terminal UI which allowed users to CRUD a team of employees based off various inputs. Users would be able to manage and create a team of employees using inquirer prompts and organize the employees by department, name, and other various ranges. 

## PROBLEMS:
Learning SQL joins was the hardest part of this project, I still do not understand them completely. Furthermore, once you join tables, it was difficult to just delete employees as the table was connected to the other two tables.

## LICENSE: MIT

## PROGRAMS USED: Node.js SQL

## USAGE AND FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
Not all functions work completely, they have some bugs due to the joining of tables. This issue needs to be resolved but I did not have the time, nor the skill to do so.

## Questions:
If you have any issues with the program or would like to discuss anything related to the project. Please reach out to me at: casino.apte@gmail.com.
